    "bio":"Born and raised in NYC, I grew up around technology.  My father ran a web development company when I was around 12 and have been a computer-geek ever since (and proud of it).  I am also a mechanical keyboard enthusiast.  I build and use my creations as tools to enhance my development skills.  You can see some of the keyboards I have built in in the Project section of my website.  As far as web programming/development, I am mainly proficient in Python, JavaScript/React HTML and CSS.  I regularly use them as well as other modules/libraries such as MatPlotLib, Pandas, Numpy and Seaborn.  I have also been studying Sentiment Analysis, and my LivingNovel.io application puts python modules such as NLTK and Vader to great use.",
